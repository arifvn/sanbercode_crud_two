## SHORT DESCRIPTION
This project is a part of sanbercode bootcamp project.
What I have learned from this project are :

0. Bootstrap tweaking
1. Eloquent vs Query Builder
2. Basic Relational Database
3. Templating blade
    - yield section (partial doc)
    - stack push (for script doc)
    - include (keeping main template clean)
4. How to handle objects dinamically back and forth between controller and view
5. Using static built in function in Eloquent for e.g. save(), get(), etc.
6. Basic CRUD
